&mytxt1=FLOOR MAT
&mytxt2=A bit ragged, but it's still one of the most popular designs.
&mytxt3=I am awake, but I cannot remember who I am!? Must have been a hell of a party last night.
&mytxt4=DOOR
&mytxt5=I slide this poster under the door..
&mytxt6=A firm wooden door. It's locked. I can't get out!
&mytxt7=KEYHOLE
&mytxt8=It's no use. I can't open it without the key.
&mytxt9=It's no use. I can't open it without the key. But I can see the key  on the other side.
&mytxt10=The key does not fit this door. Well that would have been a little to easy, eh?
&mytxt11=Let's see what's beyond this room...
&mytxt12=CHAIR
&mytxt13=No time to sit down and do nothing..
&mytxt14=BED
&mytxt15=No time to lie down and sleep, I just woke up.
&mytxt16=PILLOW
&mytxt17=Just a normal pillow.
&mytxt18=Hey, I found a key!
&mytxt19=PAINTING
&mytxt20=Okay, I unscrew the screw which the painting hangs on. Now I have a screw.
&mytxt21=A nice painting of an elephant. Very nice indeed!
&mytxt22=I leave it here!
&mytxt23=POSTER
&mytxt24=I have never seen it before, but I like it. It reminds me of the sunny beach.
&mytxt25=I leave it here for now.
&mytxt26=POSTER WITH KEY
&mytxt27=Let's see...
&mytxt28=I leave this old poster here. I don't want to carry it around in my pants.
&mytxt29=I do not want to take it with me!
&mytxt30=LOCKER
&mytxt31=It's locked.
&mytxt32=The key fits this locker as if it were made for it. Erm, it probably was anyway.
&mytxt33=CLOTHES
&mytxt34=Well these clothes seem to fit me. I might need them later on!
&mytxt35=A BOX
&mytxt36=Just rubbish inside this box.
&mytxt37=Inside the box full of rubbish I found a screwdriver! This could come in handy.
&mytxt38=Awe, it's locked.
&mytxt39=I cannot do that.. at this moment.
&mytxt40=Well, I'm afraid the screwdriver's blade is to big to fit in the keyhole..
&mytxt41=Alright, I pushed the key out of the lock. Hopefully it fell on the poster..
