&mysteryoftimeandspace=Mystery Of Time And Space

&mytxt1=A KEY
&mytxt2=Let's see where I could use this key...
&mytxt3=PUT BACK
&mytxt4=I have placed the key back into my pocket.
&mytxt5=POSTER
&mytxt6=Hmmm, how can a poster be used...?
&mytxt7=SCREWDRIVER
&mytxt8=What to do with a screwdriver?
&mytxt9=I'll use it later.
&mytxt10=THIN SCREW
&mytxt11=Where to put this screw?
&mytxt12=I'll try to screw up later, for now I'll put it back into my pocket. Very carefully...
&mytxt13=What can I unlock with this key..
&mytxt14=I forgot where I wanted to use this key that opens the door of this room.
&mytxt15=A GOLDEN KEY
&mytxt16=PEN
&mytxt17=I could use this pen...
&mytxt18=Never mind...
&mytxt19=PEN WITH INK
&mytxt20=SHARP PIN
&mytxt21=Where can I fiddle with a sharp pin...
&mytxt22=DISKETTE BOX
&mytxt23=What can I do with an empty box like this...
&mytxt24=I unlocked the box with the pin. Now I have a floppydisk and an empty diskette box.
&mytxt25=I can't open it. There's a floppydisk inside the box...
&mytxt26=FLOPPY DISK
&mytxt27=And what should I do with this floppy disk...?
&mytxt28=STONE TILE
&mytxt29=And what should I do with this stone tile...?
&mytxt30=This is heavy you know. I can't carry it around forever!
&mytxt31=And what should I do with this nice piece of crap...?
&mytxt32=Where can I dump this, it's getting heavy carrying this stone around.
&mytxt33=HEAD IN BOX
&mytxt34=Where can it be used? I know it follows lines...
&mytxt35=BIG TRIANGLE
&mytxt36=Where can I use this...
&mytxt37=SMALL TRIANGLE
&mytxt38=So, let's see where this would fit...
&mytxt39=AN OBJECT
&mytxt40=Where can it be used...?
&mytxt41=ANOTHER OBJECT
&mytxt42=TRIANGULAR OBJECT
&mytxt43=The triangular object looks like a welded puzzle.
&mytxt44=I’ll try to figure out this triangle later....
&mytxt45=PIECE OF WOOD
&mytxt46=Where can I use this piece of dry firewood?
&mytxt47=No, I'm not happy to see you, just carrying a large piece of wood around in my pants...
&mytxt48=BURNING WOOD
&mytxt49=Where to get rid of it, it's getting to hot to handle.
&mytxt50=Let me please find a use for this before I burn myself on it.
&mytxt51=LIGHT BULB
&mytxt52=Where can I use some light?
&mytxt53=I'm afraid I'm left in the dark here...
&mytxt54=BATTERY
&mytxt55=Something needs power.
&mytxt56=Hmmm...
&mytxt57=FLASHLIGHT
&mytxt58=Oh cool, it's a handheld portable light source, may be useful...
&mytxt59=A WHEEL
&mytxt60=I hope I know what I'm doing with this wheel, it may be dangerous...
&mytxt61=Okay, but I’d rather not carry this wheel for too long, it's quite heavy.
&mytxt62=SHEET OF PAPER
&mytxt63=This sheet of paper, it's so thin, you can almost see through it.
&mytxt64=Well, I hope I don't crumble it.
&mytxt65=LETTER
&mytxt66=I hope a spare part can be ordered with this, now where do I post it..?
&mytxt67=CHESS PIECE
&mytxt68=Okay, now I only need to figure out where to use it...
&mytxt69=I'm no chess master, but if I could only find the place to use this...
&mytxt70=CLOCK WEIGHTS
&mytxt71=It's heavy enough to carry around. Let's dump it somewhere...
&mytxt72=It is so heavy. Oh boy, I have to find a way to use this ballast...
&mytxt73=CARD
&mytxt74=A security card... now I bet this may prove useful!
&mytxt75=Nice and useful to have...
&mytxt76=COIN
&mytxt77=I feel like a big spender today.
&mytxt78=A penny saved is a penny earned...
&mytxt79=BALL
&mytxt80=Oh yes, I have the perfect use for this ball.
&mytxt81=Perhaps another time...
&mytxt82=CHALK
&mytxt83=So what could this be used with...
&mytxt84=I guess I'll use it later...
&mytxt85=WIRE-CUTTER
&mytxt86=Something just asks to be cut...
&mytxt87=Always handy to have.
&mytxt88=CAN OF COLA
&mytxt89=The choice of every generation...
&mytxt90=Always cool.
&mytxt91=Another key..
&mytxt92=I forgot where I want to use this key.
&mytxt93=A BUCKET
&mytxt94=It's an old bucket.. complete with some holes in it.
&mytxt95=When I figure out where to use this....
&mytxt96=A FILLED BUCKET
&mytxt97=This bucket is filled with water.. The tape seems to be holding.. for now....
&mytxt98=It's getting heavy carrying this around... wet also..

&mytxt99=TAPE
&mytxt100=A roll of waterproof tape, now this is exactly what I need.
&mytxt101=I’ll use the tape when I’ve figured out what it does.
&mytxt102=CHAIR
&mytxt103=DOOR
&mytxt104=PAINTING
&mytxt105=SOFA
&mytxt106=CABINET
&mytxt107=CUPBOARD
&mytxt108=BUTTON
&mytxt109=SWITCH
&mytxt110=TABLE
&mytxt111=LAMP
&mytxt112=LOCKER
&mytxt113=ANOTHER ROOM

&mytxt114=SPADE
&mytxt115=I wonder how this will be useful.
&mytxt116=ROPE
&mytxt117=AXE

&mytxt10000=29&mytxt10001=It's a solid chair. No time to sit down though.
&mytxt10002=Nice chair.
&mytxt10003=Well, if I had the time to sit down I would probably give it a try.
&mytxt10004=Nice to see you can take a seat, if you need one.
&mytxt10005=Whomever thought of this chair design is a genius.
&mytxt10006=I don't have time to sit down.
&mytxt10007=It is an old looking chair. Nothing special about it.
&mytxt10008=Whenever I see a chair I think I might need it.
&mytxt10009=What?
&mytxt10010=I cannot and will not take chairs with me.
&mytxt10011=After sitting down for a second, I'm totally refreshed.
&mytxt10012=...
&mytxt10013=What is it with the obsession with chairs anyway.
&mytxt10014=Chairs, do people still use them today?
&mytxt10015=A chair, it doesn't look very confortable though.
&mytxt10016=Might want to take a rest later, but not now...
&mytxt10017=Chair. Cheap. Solid. Reliable.
&mytxt10018=Nice, the designers of this place thought about some furniture.
&mytxt10019=Heh, you really expect me to do something neat with a chair?
&mytxt10020=It's a chair.
&mytxt10021=Oh this looks comfortable enough to sit on for hours - NOT.
&mytxt10022=Just a chair.
&mytxt10023=It's not the time to sit down and do nothing.
&mytxt10024=On other days I would have loved to take a seat but not now.
&mytxt10025=If you have seen one chair you really seen them all.
&mytxt10026=How neat. But not interesting though.
&mytxt10027=I think I have seen enough of them.
&mytxt10028=Another chair, nothing special nor to get excited about.
&mytxt10029=I won't sit down now.
&mytxt10030=What was I thinking. I have no time to sit down.



&mytxt12000=35&mytxt12001=Nothing special I'm afraid.
&mytxt12002=I thought I saw something, nope, nothing...
&mytxt12003=Perhaps I'm looking in all the wrong places, because there is nothing interesting here.
&mytxt12004=My search was futile, I found nothing.
&mytxt12005=Unless I'm blind there seems to be nothing of interest.
&mytxt12006=I see nothing interesting.
&mytxt12007=My search turned up nothing interesting or something I could use.
&mytxt12008=After looking again I found there was nothing I overlooked.
&mytxt12009=This old and dusty place hides nothing interesting.
&mytxt12010=Wondering if I ever find something in here.
&mytxt12011=I need needful things, why aren't there any in here?
&mytxt12012=Sadly my efforts were fruitless. You guessed right, I found nothing.
&mytxt12013=Most of the times my searches result in finding nothing. This is one of those times.
&mytxt12014=Apart from some rubbish there's nothing of interest. And even that rubbish is uninteresting.
&mytxt12015=Hopefully my next search will result in a more satisfactionary way.
&mytxt12016=I found nothing, but at least I got some exercise.
&mytxt12017=Njente, noppes, nada, null, zip, nothing.
&mytxt12018=Hmm, I could have sworn I’d find a hidden passage here!
&mytxt12019=Where's that thing -what’s-it-called- that I so desperately need?
&mytxt12020=Just my luck, after searching I came up with nothing.
&mytxt12021=Hmmm, so much useless stuff. And useless stuff will not help me here.
&mytxt12022=I searched that place. I found nothing. Not even a clue to where I am.
&mytxt12023=There's nothing with a WOW factor here. I found nothing, not even an item I may need.
&mytxt12024=I found nothing, not even a plot line revelation.
&mytxt12025=I found nothing, not even a mystery puzzle nor an interesting item.
&mytxt12026=I found nothing, not even a major clue.
&mytxt12027=I found nothing, not even a ridiculous artifact.
&mytxt12028=I found nothing, not even a pair of sunglasses.
&mytxt12029=I found nothing, not even a clue to the Mystery of Time and Space.
&mytxt12030=I found nothing, not even a lost wallet, nor a bundle of money; not that I would need it.
&mytxt12031=I’ve already searched here before, I remember. Just checking if I missed something important.
&mytxt12032=My search revealed nothing of importance.
&mytxt12033=My eyes try to pierce the darkness. My hands feel around. Sadly without any result.
&mytxt12034=Hmmm I should not concern myself with this.
&mytxt12035=It really would have been great if I would find something for once.
&mytxt12036=You probably guessed it, there's really nothing of interest.


&mytxt14000=36&mytxt14001=I use my incredible strength to open this, but still it resists and won't open.
&mytxt14002=Perhaps using a key or an object would help. I'm not sure though.
&mytxt14003=Awe, it's locked. Where's a crow bar when you need one.
&mytxt14004=Shoot, it's locked. I wish I had the key to this problem.
&mytxt14005=I could have guessed it, it's locked.
&mytxt14006=Locked. Funny, this does not come as a surprise to me.
&mytxt14007=Locked? Then something very important could be inside.
&mytxt14008=Hmmm, will I ever be able to unlock this?
&mytxt14009=Oh no, another one locked. What's there to hide I ask myself.
&mytxt14010=I'm unable to look inside this way because the door is locked.
&mytxt14011=Locked, locked, and locked. Unable to open this way.
&mytxt14012=I wonder if I could find a key to open this. Or a bazooka.
&mytxt14013=Perhaps I should think this over. I'm unable to open it with my bare hands.
&mytxt14014=The urge to look inside is much greater when you can't look inside at all.
&mytxt14015=Perhaps I should find something to unlock this door.
&mytxt14016=I need to look inside. This is impossible due to my inability to open it.
&mytxt14017=I'm unable to open it. Perhaps I need a key to open it. Perhaps it's locked forever.
&mytxt14018=It's locked.
&mytxt14019=Awe, locked.
&mytxt14020=After careful consideration, I found it to be locked.
&mytxt14021=Can't open it.
&mytxt14022=Hmm, why is it locked?
&mytxt14023=Whatever I try, I cannot seem to open it. It's locked!
&mytxt14024=Nope. Locked.
&mytxt14025=Just as I expected, it's tightly locked.
&mytxt14026=How?
&mytxt14027=Eh, it's no use. It will not open.
&mytxt14028=It must be locked.
&mytxt14029=...
&mytxt14030=Trying my best isn't enough... It's locked.
&mytxt14031=I thought I saw movement, but sadly.. still locked.
&mytxt14032=I scratch, scream, and kick, but it is still locked.
&mytxt14033=What?? Locked!!
&mytxt14034=I try opening it but sadly I can't.
&mytxt14035=How mysterious, it's locked.
&mytxt14036=Locked things always make me wonder what's locked up.
&mytxt14037=It is locked.


// use useless object to open door
&mytxt15000=14&mytxt15001=This action seems to be fruitless.
&mytxt15002=Object... Not responding... As expected.
&mytxt15003=This must be the wrong place to use this object.
&mytxt15004=It's not working.
&mytxt15005=Oh no, I’ve almost broken this object by using it in the wrong place.
&mytxt15006=Having to find out I'm doing all the wrong actions here.
&mytxt15007=Needless to say that using this object did not produce any results.
&mytxt15008=Yeah right, like if it was meant to work together.
&mytxt15009=Nope, it's not plausible to use this here.
&mytxt15010=Can we try something else? This is not working at all.
&mytxt15011=Frustrating but true, it's just not working.
&mytxt15012=I'm not sure if I can use an object here.
&mytxt15013=Nothing happens.
&mytxt15014=Other than making some scratches, my actions were fruitless.
&mytxt15015=Hmm, I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do right now.

//unlocked something like a door or a locker
&mytxt16000=8&mytxt16001=Yeah, I’ve unlocked another part of this mystery.
&mytxt16002=Okay, this seemed to have worked. It's unlocked.
&mytxt16003=It seems like I’ve figured it out. Now it's open.
&mytxt16004=It was tricky but finally I’ve managed to unlock another piece of this mystery.
&mytxt16005=Aaaah, this is the way I like it. Makes me feel smart for once.
&mytxt16006=I wonder why I did not do that earlier.
&mytxt16007=Nice to see I still have it in me.
&mytxt16008=Must be my lucky day.
&mytxt16009=yeah.

&mytxt17000=10&mytxt17001=I’ve opened it.
&mytxt17002=Hey, incredible, I have found something that is not locked.
&mytxt17003=Sesame open. And yes, it worked.
&mytxt17004=This door makes a creepy noise when I open it.
&mytxt17005=Does this reveal something of the mystery?
&mytxt17006=Let's take a look.
&mytxt17007=Carefully I open this door. I don't want to break the old looking door.
&mytxt17008=Hmm, think of the possibilities of things I could find in here. Scary...
&mytxt17009=Neat to see so much detail in the movement.
&mytxt17010=I hope I will find some answers in here.
&mytxt17011=Let's take a peek inside.

//close door
&mytxt18000=8&mytxt18001=I’ve closed it again.
&mytxt18002=I’ve closed the door.
&mytxt18003=I’ve closed the door again.
&mytxt18004=I’ve closed it.
&mytxt18005=Well, I can close it too I see.
&mytxt18006=Now it's closed again.
&mytxt18007=Click, it's shut.
&mytxt18008=Closed.
&mytxt18009=Click.

//walk door
&mytxt19000=8&mytxt19001=Let's see.
&mytxt19002=I've walked here.
&mytxt19003=So many rooms.
&mytxt19004=Let's see what I could find here.
&mytxt19005=Again I enter a room.
&mytxt19006=I do move around a lot in here.
&mytxt19007=So now I'm here.
&mytxt19008=What am I doing here.
&mytxt19009=I've walked into another of those rooms.

//light on
&mytxt20000=8&mytxt20001=Let there be light.
&mytxt20002=I’ve turned on the light.
&mytxt20003=This will brighten my day.
&mytxt20004=Wow, how incredible, interactive light.
&mytxt20005=The room becomes visible.
&mytxt20006=I turn on the light and the darkness vanishes.
&mytxt20007=I turn on the light to see what happens.
&mytxt20008=How exciting, the light turns on.
&mytxt20009=Nice to have light in case I need it.

//light off
&mytxt21000=8&mytxt21001=I’ve turned off the light, saves a little energy this way.
&mytxt21002=I’ve turned off the light.
&mytxt21003=The lamp is now off.
&mytxt21004=Okay, turned off.
&mytxt21005=I’ve turned off the light.
&mytxt21006=Because I don't know what I'm doing, I’ve turned off the light … see what happens...
&mytxt21007=I have turned off the light.
&mytxt21008=Off.
&mytxt21009=Turned off.
&mytxt21010=
//text table
&mytxt22000=8&mytxt22001=A table.
&mytxt22002=It's a table.
&mytxt22003=Just a normal table.
&mytxt22004=Okay, check out this table.
&mytxt22005=Nice table.
&mytxt22006=Why are there always more chairs than tables around?
&mytxt22007=Nice to be reminded of this useless table.
&mytxt22008=It's a table. So?
&mytxt22009=Ah, a table.
&mytxt22010=
//text press button
&mytxt23000=8&mytxt23001=I’ve pressed the button.
&mytxt23002=Button pressed.
&mytxt23003=Click.
&mytxt23004=I press this button.
&mytxt23005=I’ve pressed this button.
&mytxt23006=I press the button, hopefully, I know what I'm doing.
&mytxt23007=I press the button, but have no idea if it helps me.
&mytxt23008=I’ve pressed the button hoping it does not turn off the life support in this place.
&mytxt23009=Pressing this button may do some good.
&mytxt23010=
