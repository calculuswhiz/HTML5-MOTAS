&mytxt1=Complex TheoriesSince the beginning of time and space, the universe keeps evolving into a very complex system of interacting elements, from solar systems to micro organisms.We, the observers of time and space, have witnessed every aspect of the universe from every possible angle.

&mytxt2=Complex TheoriesIt was not always like this. Once we were a race of beings roaming the universe on search for answers and knowledge, but only found more questions and misery.Eons have passed before the first member of our people realized that there was a deeper structured process behind the common reality we were able to see and live. But to observe this alternate reality was only possible if the observer had no memory of the common reality.
