&mytxt1=Very minimalistic approach, but otherwise nothing interesting.
&mytxt2=Lucky for me there are enough cheap tools around.
&mytxt3=A poster on the wall displays a striking composition. Girl Power...
&mytxt4=PANEL
&mytxt5=Very weird looking furniture here.
&mytxt6=It seems to be to display something.
&mytxt7=I found a string sticking out of this force field generator..
&mytxt8=STRING
&mytxt9=I can use the weights to keep the string pulled down..
&mytxt10=If I pull this string, the force field is turned off, but switches back on when I release it.
&mytxt11=My trick worked. The weights keep the force field deactivated.
&mytxt12="Our security forces are on the look out for an escaped clone. Be on the look out."
&mytxt13=NOTE
&mytxt14="Please don't touch any machinery. They are proven to be cheap garbage."
&mytxt15="No unauthorised time travel..."
&mytxt16="Please no more sticky notes."
&mytxt17="No problem... PS. Suprise bithday party canceled."
&mytxt18=ALIEN MACHINE
&mytxt19=I am curious what these machines do, but they could as well be just a decorative element.
&mytxt20=Very economical creatures, why buy only one if you can have more for a reduced price.
&mytxt21=Another alien machine. I hope they aren't nuclear...Or gas, also not healthy.
&mytxt22=WHOOAH, this machine is broken and is leaking a glowing fluid!!
&mytxt23=Some glowing green stuff has been spilled here. It smells bad.
&mytxt24=I removed the grating revealing a long and narrow ventilation shaft.
&mytxt25=I need a tool to remove this grating...
&mytxt26=GRATING
&mytxt27=I think I'm to lazy to put it back up again. I'm glad I finally got it off.
&mytxt28=Aparently this wall was a distraction. It reveals another section of this room..
&mytxt29=It's a machine that generates a force field surrounding the chess piece.
&mytxt30=A strange kind of force field is shielding a decorative image of a chess piece.
&mytxt31=I take the chess tile. Perhaps I feel like playing later on.
&mytxt32=Not yet...
&mytxt33=These heavy balls are used to unwind the clock mechanism. How interesting.
&mytxt34=CLOCK
&mytxt35=This clock looks old. But it's still on time.
&mytxt36=Don't expect me to carry that old clock around with me. And it's broken anyway.
&mytxt37=PEDESTAL
&mytxt38=I placed the image of the chess piece on the pedestal. It activated some sort of mechanism.
&mytxt39=A strange pedestal. It seems like I have to put something on it. But what?
&mytxt40=A tile with the symbol of a horse on it. Let's play chess...
&mytxt41=CHESS TILE
&mytxt42=It looks like a gigantic chess board of some sort.
&mytxt43=Well, the chess tile is locked in place.
&mytxt44="Make sure you don't walk into an airlock unprotected."
&mytxt45=I have put on this fantastic looking protection suit that makes me look like an alien insect.
&mytxt46=ALIEN SUIT
&mytxt47=And what is behind door number 1. Wow, it's... it's... what is it?
&mytxt48=And what is behind door number 2? Awe, the door is stuck... I cannot open it.
&mytxt49=AIR LOCK
&mytxt50=AIR LOCK DOOR
&mytxt51=ENTER AIR LOCK
&mytxt52=I am wearing a protective suit now. Well, here I go.... again...
&mytxt53=Hmm, I think I need some extra protection before I dare to proceed through this air lock...
&mytxt54=Something's happening...
&mytxt55=An instant full featured decorated tree.
&mytxt56="Merry Christmas" and a "Happy New Year" card.
&mytxt57=This is a burning fireplace. Big problem when your name is Santa.
&mytxt58=Aha, the chess puzzle deactivated the barrier.
&mytxt59=Some sort of laser barrier is blocking the way, I can see a long passage way.
&mytxt60=Aha, I got one.
&mytxt61=That didn't add up. I wonder...
&mytxt62=A strange panel. What's up with this one...
