&mytxt1=Oh right, if I knew what it was I would not be standing here wondering what it is.
&mytxt2=PAINTING
&mytxt3=What is that suppose to be? Looks kinda alien to me.
&mytxt4=BIG BOX
&mytxt5=A box filled with unpleasant smelling pieces of old paper. Old magazines perhaps...
&mytxt6=CABLE
&mytxt7=Just a cable.
&mytxt8=Oh, this is an ugly poster.
&mytxt9=I don't have the time to read all eighteen volumes of books. "Encyclopedia" it's called.
&mytxt10=BOOKS
&mytxt11=There are more books here. A little library perhaps.
&mytxt12=MORE BOOKS
&mytxt13=A similar design as in some of the other rooms.
&mytxt14=CABINET
&mytxt15=I'm curious what's behind this. I'm just strong enough to move the cabinet aside.
&mytxt16=I can't move it far enough... But I see a door hidden behind the cabinet. Strange place.
&mytxt17=I push it back to it's original position.
&mytxt18=SOMETHING
&mytxt19=There is something hidden behind this cabinet.
&mytxt20=There is something hidden behind this cabinet. I can see a door.
&mytxt21=I push this box aside. Phew, heavy.
&mytxt22=BIG MOVING BOX
&mytxt23=I can't push it back to it's previous position, because the cabinet is standing there.
&mytxt24=I don't know why, but I push this big box back to it's previous position.
&mytxt25=CLOCK
&mytxt26=Time keeps on turning...
&mytxt27=SMALL PANEL
&mytxt28=I opened the small panel. It was unlocked by that stupid puzzle lock.
&mytxt29=It's a small panel, but I can't open it.
&mytxt30=Great, I found a key...
&mytxt31=CABINET DOOR
&mytxt32=I closed it again.
&mytxt33=KEY PAD
&mytxt34=Hmmm.
&mytxt35=I completed the sequence. I probably unlocked something else.
&mytxt36=DOOR
&mytxt37=Still locked?? What is this, I completed the sequence allright! Something else perhaps?
&mytxt38=I close the door. It's getting cold inhere...
&mytxt39=ANOTHER ROOM
&mytxt40=Let's see...
&mytxt41=BUTTON
&mytxt42=I pressed the button. Okay, I got it right.
&mytxt43=I pressed the button. Whoops, it seemed to be the wrong symbol.
&mytxt44=This is a funny looking codepad, I wonder if I can handle it...
&mytxt45=BACK
&mytxt46=I figure it out a little later.
