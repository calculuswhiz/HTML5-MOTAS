&mytxt1=A BUCKET
&mytxt2=Well well.. okay let's take this rusty bucked including authentic holes with me.
&mytxt3=A POSTER
&mytxt4=Linux, huh, it's a neat animal. Looks it can stand the heat.
&mytxt5=Windows, huh, I haven't seen any without gates around here... All locked up.
&mytxt6=Macintosh, huh, I guess we're all smiles now.
&mytxt7=Commodore, huh, I've seen this logo before. Must be cool to have a Commodore.
&mytxt8=SWITCH
&mytxt9=Funkey invention. Imagine life without switches, without the fear to press the wrong one.
&mytxt10=I let it read this card. Yes, it activated a secret wall.
&mytxt11=The eye... it's looking for something..
&mytxt12=Hmm, is this a real wall?
&mytxt13=A painting of the sun.
&mytxt14="\"In the "+direction+" the yellow sun shines bright.\""
&mytxt15=A painting of the sky.
&mytxt16=A painting of fire.
&mytxt17=A painting of a tree.
&mytxt18=north
&mytxt19=west
&mytxt20=east
&mytxt21=south
&mytxt22="\"In the "+direction+" the skies are blue.\""
&mytxt23=WOW this bird flies away...
&mytxt24=This is a painting of a nice green landscape.
&mytxt25=...right out of a painting that hangs on the  wall... !?? How can this be?
&mytxt26=This is a painting of a nice green landscape. This is where the bird went... Incredible.
&mytxt27=WHITE DOVE
&mytxt28=Oh what an old carriage.  When I knock on it it makes a hollow sound. It's probably empty.
&mytxt29=The carriage suddenly moves, I'm lucky it did not run over me...
&mytxt30=I just removed this wedge shaped piece of wood.
&mytxt31=MAN HOLE
&mytxt32=Hey, it's that funny bird again...
&mytxt33=Ah, finally, the great outdoors.
&mytxt34=When I opened the manhole a mechanism  started moving and a cable is now connected.
&mytxt35=Well, well.... it's a well. A real classic design also.
&mytxt36=An old rope hangs out of the well..
&mytxt37=After making a tight knot, the bucket is now tied to the old rope.
&mytxt38=There, now let's see the bucket in action...
&mytxt39=There's still water in the well but after looking inside the well I decided not to jump in.
&mytxt40=Be carefull what you whish for...
&mytxt41=GO LEFT
&mytxt42=GO RIGHT
&mytxt43=It's a big tree. It's nice to see something natural after being locked up inside all this time.
&mytxt44=Let's take a look at what this panel is hiding.
&mytxt45=A fire burns near to the door, with this heat I cannot open the doors.
&mytxt46=I am not going to put my hands into a burning fire. I'm not that stupid.
&mytxt47=Cool! I used the water to extinguish the fire.
&mytxt48=There is not enough power to make the elevator work.
&mytxt49=Okay, I have found some waterproof tape on the shelves.
&mytxt50=SHELVES
&mytxt51=The bucket needs to be fixed...
&mytxt52=I now have a golden key.
