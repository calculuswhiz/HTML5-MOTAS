&mytxt3=Hey, I found a metal triangular object inside the panel.
&mytxt4=A took a triangle from the panel. It's powered down now.
&mytxt5=SECURITY PANEL
&mytxt6=Very nice looking sofa, although I'm not going to try them.
&mytxt7=SOFA
&mytxt8=Now this is a cool table. I like it alot.. I think..
&mytxt9=TABLE
&mytxt10=Okay I have taken a piece of fire wood. Perhaps I should put it back later.
&mytxt11=I lighted the fireplace. It will get warmer here in a while.
&mytxt12=I already have taken a piece of fire wood. Perhaps I should put it back later.
&mytxt13=FIRE WOOD
&mytxt14=This is a cute fireplace, so romantic and warm. Well if it was burning anyway.
&mytxt15=This is a cute fireplace, so romantic and warm now it's turned on. And it saves electricity.
&mytxt16=I'm back in the room where I entered this part of the building.
&mytxt17=WALK HERE
&mytxt18=Another of those locked door's, what's with that.
&mytxt19=DOOR
&mytxt20=I open the door, let's see what's behind it.
&mytxt21=ANOTHER ROOM
&mytxt22=Let's see...
&mytxt23=I close the door.
&mytxt24=I've walked into this room.
&mytxt25=Abstract painting of a hand I presume...
&mytxt26=Oh no, the temperature control is broken, and it is set to 22 degrees celsius.
&mytxt27=TEMPERATURE CONTROL
&mytxt28=HEATING RADIATOR
&mytxt29=It gererates heat. It's to hot to touch with my bare hands. I would burn myself.
&mytxt30=It's cooling down now.
&mytxt31=I turned the lamp on. Nice one by the way.
&mytxt32=LAMP
&mytxt33=I turned the lamp off, it saves energy that way.
&mytxt34=Well look what we have here. A single sofa, very confortable and placed in a quiet room.
&mytxt35=I've walked into this room with a machine in it.
&mytxt36=Nothing I could think of to carry it around for.
&mytxt37=I'm back in the room where I entered this part of the building.
&mytxt38=CHAIR
&mytxt39=Another chair. These things must be very cheap to have so many of them.
&mytxt40=A similar design as in some of the other rooms, only this one has a door.
&mytxt41=CABINET
&mytxt42=Let's see what's inside.
&mytxt43=CABINET DOOR
&mytxt44=I closed it again.
&mytxt45=Acme? Sounds a little cartoonish to me... Cutting edge technologie probably.
&mytxt46=BIG MACHINE
&mytxt47=This holds the red glass like object. I wonder what it is used for and how it works.
&mytxt48=It feels warm, even when the machine is turned off.
&mytxt49=I can't move it, although it seems to me made for it.
&mytxt50=Looks like a big eh, thing, cutting edge, I'm sure.
&mytxt51=The machine is turned off.
&mytxt52=I turned it on, but the machine seems low on power...
&mytxt53=Pressing this red button results in a shutdown of the machine.
&mytxt54=Now it has cut the metal triangle into several small pieces.
&mytxt55=It set the wood on fire.
&mytxt56=Hmmmm, this looks like a placeholder for something. Oh no, I don't put my hand there!
&mytxt57=Okay, I put the triangular object here on the placeholder.
&mytxt58=I lay this piece of wood on the placeholder.
&mytxt59=PLACE HOLDER
&mytxt60=TRIANGLE
&mytxt61=I take it back.
&mytxt62=TRIANGLE PIECES
&mytxt63=PIECE OF WOOD
&mytxt64=PIECE OF BURNING WOOD
&mytxt65=This looks like a painting of a sculpture of a creature of somesort.
&mytxt66=The open security box reveals a mechanism of somesort.
&mytxt67=I moved back.
&mytxt68=Yeah, I did it, I unlocked another door!
&mytxt69=Yeah I managed to solve this puzzle and unlocked another door.
&mytxt70=The secutiry panel is active again.
&mytxt71=The secutiry panel is off, but the door is still locked.
&mytxt72=Look, a beam of red light emminates from the red cristal.
&mytxt73=Full power now...
&mytxt74=I turned it on, but the machine seems low on power...
