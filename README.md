# HTML5-MOTAS
My attempt at a port of the classic Flash game, Mystery of Time and Space by Jan Albartus.


# About me
I'm just some dude who remembers playing MOTAS back in the 2000's. I've never really been a fan of room escape games, but for some reason, the surreal nature of MOTAS really just stuck with me throughout the years. In fact, if I were to name my top Flash game of all time, MOTAS would be it.

My qualifications: I got a job as a Flash Developer back in late 2016, and my big project was to convert our entire Flash library (over 3000 .FLA files) to HTML5, so this is not a new thing for me (yay). I'm also pretty good at HTML/JS as well as I'm a Full Stack developer now.

# This Repo
I would like to upload the ported game files as I go. Hopefully, I can make some meaningful progress in the next few weeks.

The wiki is where I will document my progress through porting MOTAS to HTML5. There will be difficulties, I'm sure, but I think this is going to be fun.
